Pimp nigga
Breakin' on a bitch nigga
Drinking on some Crown, clown
Watch me whip a dirty hoe down
I was raised to dog 'em all
Smack 'em up, jack 'em up
Push 'em to the wall, dawg
Fill they mouth up full of nut
Fuck 'em in the-
Bunk bed or the fuckin' toilet bowl
It really don't matter to me, 'cause she a G, won't make your pockets swole
Now I gotta dump that hoe, but she wanna stick me
With a fuckin' knife, bitch, I'm strapped with an Uzi
Bitches are dumber than motherfucker steppin' up to me with that shit
Knowin' that a player, ain't barrin' no bitch
Groupies on my fuckin' dick, resthaven niggas, make me sick
Once I got my ass in, some busters couldn't even stand a playa
Just because I'm on that other level, I don't need to hear
Long as a nigga got some bitches by his side
That's all a nigga need, and a clean ass ride
See, if weren't for the bitches on the motherfuckin' track
A playa wouldn't be stackin', that's why I'm ridin' clean, bitch
Damn girl, you got a good man
What's your man name?
Haven't you heard, The Skinny, Skinny, Skinny Pimp?
The rapper?
That's him
That's my man
Bitch, I can't to motherfuckin' tell
Skinny motherfuckin' Pimp, talkin' about a dirty tramp
Like a nigga supposed to, 'cause they know the shit is true
Dick suckin', I know they love it, 'cause they do it a whole lot
Gossipin' ass bitch, always on a dope dealers jock
Just because he slangin' yay, got the freaky bitch high cappin'
Actin' like she's stuck up, knowin', she goin', that's why lil' pimpin' jackin'
On that hoe, come to find out he's a hoe
'Cause he be crying, everytime he do a crime
She be fuckin' all the time
The reason a nigga that leave with quickness
He was sprung off the money he givin her
Knife, bitch, I'm strapped with an Uzi
Bitches are dumber than-
The reason a nigga that leave with quickness
He was sprung off the money he givin her
Me, 'cause she a G, won't make your pockets swole
Now I gotta-
Motherfucker steppin' up to me with that shit
Knowin' that a player, ain't barrin' no bitch
Groupies on my fucking dick, resthaven niggas, make me sick
Once I got my ass in, some busters couldn't even stand a playa
Just because I'm on that other level I don't need to hear
Long as a nigga got some bitches by his side
That's all a nigga need, and a clean ass ride
See, if weren't for the bitches on the motherfuckin' track
A playa wouldn't be stackin', that's why I'm ridin' clean, bitch
