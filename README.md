# GoNexus
An attempt to bring back GoAnimate For Schools and a sort of "continuation" of the obsolte project "GoAnimate For Schools Remastered". Currently private and closed source but that'll change in the future. This is also a great alternative for FlashThemes if you claim to have the following problems with the site:
* The site is too slow and loads slow even though i have good WI-FI.
* i am having problems creating an account.
* and etc.

also the codename is BetterWrapper.

## Final Release Version
Yes, this project is an alternative to FlashThemes, but our team desided that it's not worth the time to work on GoNexus anymore. For the final release version, it is version 0.0.2.
After this release, this project will no longer be worked on. Don't worry, i, josephanimate, am trying to implment as much features as possible before this project gets put into archive.
