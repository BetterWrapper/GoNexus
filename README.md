# GoNexus

## About
GoNexus is an LVM clone which brings back GoAnimate for Schools and a sort of "continuation" of the obsolete project "GoAnimate for Schools Remastered". It is currently private and closed source but that'll change once the final version is released. This is also a great alternative for FlashThemes if you claim to have the following problems with the site:
* The site is too slow and loads slow even though I have good Wi-Fi like Starlink.
* I have problems creating an account.
* FlashThemes has serverside crashes, etc.

Codenames are BetterWrapper, and OrangeAura.
